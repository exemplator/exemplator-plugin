[![apm](https://img.shields.io/apm/v/badges.svg)](https://atom.io/packages/exemplator-plugin)

An [Atom](https://atom.io/) plugin for Exemplator. Find usage examples of your favourite, ambiguous Java methods right inside atom.

For more information take a look at the [exemplator](https://github.com/exemplator/exemplator) repository.

You can also access Exemplator on the web, [here](https://exemplator.xyz).

### Usage

Inside Atom:
- To toggle the example view with ```Shift + Alt + T```  
- To find usage examples of a method put the cursor on the desired method and do ```Shift + Alt + E```

Alternatively you can do the same thing through the Exemplator menu.

The plugin is still under development and only supports Java method examples as of right now.

### Contributing

To build the plugin locally, you need Atom installed. Then clone the project and run:

1. ```apm install```
2. ```apm link```
